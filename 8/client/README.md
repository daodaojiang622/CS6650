**Client for HW8**

To start the program:
1. Go to the server folder and read the README there
2. Edit the IPAddr in the Client.java
3. Make sure the GROUP_SIZE, NUM_OF_GROUPS, and DELAY in the Client.java are correct

Note: 
- There is no need to add your image, I placed one in the resources folder
- Data folder will be named after GROUP_SIZE, NUM_OF_GROUPS, and DELAY
  - If the data folder already exists, the program will auto rewrite so no need to manually delete
